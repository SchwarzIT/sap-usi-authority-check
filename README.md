# sap-usi-authority-check
The repository contains the helper class /USI/CL_AUTH that can be used to check, if the user is authorized for the current transaction.

According to our development guidelines, the class must be used in all USI reports to secure them against unauthorized access. 

Because of this rule, many of our developments depend on this component.

# Installation Guide
This component has no dependencies and no special authorizations are required.
