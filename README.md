# USI Authority Check
This repository contains the helper class /USI/CL_AUTH that checks, if the user is authorized for the current transaction.

The class is very simple and would not be worth sharing, but according to our internal development guidelines, it must be used in all USI reports to secure them against unauthorized access.

Because of this rule, many of our developments depend on this class.

# Installation Guide
This component has no dependencies and no special authorizations are required.
